## üìö Overview

This microservice handles all review-related operations within the Urban Assist application. Built with Node.js and Express, it integrates with MySQL for data storage and RabbitMQ for asynchronous operations.

<details>
<summary>‚ú® Key Features</summary>

- **Asynchronous Processing** - RabbitMQ for handling provider deletion events, contributing to the resiliency in the features.
- **CRUD Operations** - Add, fetch, and delete reviews
- **User Authentication** - Secure endpoints with JWT-based authentication
- **Role-Based Authorization** - Fine-grained access control for users and admins
- **Database Integration** - Seamless MySQL support via Sequelize ORM

- **Scalability** - Auto-scaling in Kubernetes environments
- **High Availability** - Multi-node deployment for failover protection
- **Rolling Updates** - Zero-downtime deployments with Kubernetes
- **Resource Efficiency** - Optimized container footprint for better resource utilization

</details>
